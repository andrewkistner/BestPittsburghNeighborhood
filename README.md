# Best Pittsburgh Neighborhood
This repository is for the final project for Pitt's Big Ideas in Computing and Information course. This is a group project where the group will use Python, pandas, and matplotlib to analyze datasets about neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh area.

* Team Name: ACC
* Team Members:
  * Andrew Kistner - ank243@pitt.edu
  * Camden Callahan - cjc184@pitt.edu
  * Carter Keith - cpk29@pitt.edu

* The first dataset we used to determine the best Pittsburgh neighborhood was data from the Pittsburgh police on all arrests in the Pittsburgh area. The link to this dataset can be found [here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/arrest-data).
* The second dataset we used contains data that shows the different pieces of playground equipment in the neighborhoods across Pittsburgh. The link to this dataset can be found [here](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/playground-equipment).

* When asked what the best neighborhood is in Pittsburgh, our data points straight to Regent Square. We were able to determine this since our metric of arrest numbers was lower for Regent Square and our metric of playground equipment was fairly high for Regent Square.
